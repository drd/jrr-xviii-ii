  I‘m a Product Designer in Portland, OR. I design fun and easy to use websites
  and apps. And I’m nice.

  On my ninth birthday, I bought my first copy of _Dark Side of the Moon_, on
  cassette. I'd never heard of Pink Floyd, I just liked the cover: a ray of
  light passing through a prism, splitting into a rainbow of frequencies. I
  liked the colors. I studied that cover for a hours and hours, and eventually
  went on to study light and optics because of it. Soon afterwards, I went to
  London to work with the late Storm Thorgerson – the designer of that image –
  in London. I became a graphic designer because images like that one captivate
  me. I have a framed art print of the prism on my wall, and every day it
  reminds me of the power design has to change lives.

I see design as problem solving. How can we best communicate complex ideas using simple tools such as color, shape, and text? How can we use imagination and creativity to make those ideas more compelling? How can we make complex interactions feel simple? These questions have heavily influenced who I am today. 

I am now a product designer with over a dozen years of experience making websites and apps. I am passionate about design systems and organizational design thinking, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development. I believe that constant collaboration with engineers and users makes for the best products. I love when an app surprises me by making something complicated feel simple, and I aim for that achievement in my work constantly.

I've worked at agencies, run my own consultancies, partnerships, and startups, and was the Lead Designer at Idealist, a large international non-profit for five years. I am currently co-designing an app that helps musicians collaborate and am driven to make the world a more enjoyable place through my work.

In addition to design, I play bass in a post-psychedelic rock band and love to draw. My best friend is a retired racing greyhound and we spend most evenings walking the neighborhoods of Portland together. (She pees in public a lot more often than I do.) Most of my time behind a computer looks like this:
