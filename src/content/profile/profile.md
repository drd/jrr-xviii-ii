A single image can have a profound effect on a person. 

At the ripe old age of about nine, I bought my first copy of Dark Side of the Moon on cassette. I'd never heard of Pink Floyd, I just liked the cover: a ray of light entering a prism which divides into a rainbow of frequencies. I studied that cover for a hours and hours, and eventually went on to study light and optics because of it. I became a designer because images like that one captivate me. And soon afterwards I went to London to work with the late Storm Thorgerson, the designer of that image, in London.

I see design as problem solving. How can we best communicate complex ideas using simple tools such as color, shape, and text? How can we use imagination and creativity to make those ideas more compelling?

Design has heavily influenced who I am today.
