At the ripe old age of about nine, I bought my first copy of Dark Side of the Moon, on cassette. I'd never heard of Pink Floyd, I just liked the cover: a ray of light entering a prism which divides into a rainbow of frequencies. I liked the colors. I studied that cover for a hours and hours, and eventually went on to study light and optics because of it. I became a designer because images like that one captivate me. Soon afterwards, I went to London to work with the late Storm Thorgerson, the designer of that image, in London. I have a framed art print of the prism on my wall, and every day it reminds me of the power of design.

I see design as problem solving. How can we best communicate complex ideas using simple tools such as color, shape, and text? How can we use imagination and creativity to make those ideas more compelling? These questions have heavily influenced who I am today. 

I am a product designer with over a dozen years of experience making websites and apps. I am passionate about design systems and organizational design thinking, wireframing, prototyping, and front-end development. I believe that constant collaboration with engineers and users makes for the best products. I love when an app surprises me by making something complicated feel simple, and I aim for that achievement in my work constantly.

I have worked at agencies, run my own consultancies, partnerships, and startups, and was the lead designer at Idealist, a large international non-profit for five years. I am currently co-designing an app that helps musicians collaborate.

In addition to design, I play bass in a post-psychedelic rock band and my best friend is a retired racing greyhound. Most of my time behind a computer looks like this:
