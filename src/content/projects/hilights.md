## INTRODUCTION: THE PROBLEM

My buddy and I are in a band together and we are frequently frustrated when we listen  to recordings of our practices and want to discuss a particular section of the music. Conversations usually go something like this:

> **Him:** That first jam was cool. Your bassline sounds amazing.*
>
> **Me:**  Oh, yeah? What one? I played like three amazing basslines during that jam if I remember correctly.
>
> **Him:** Well, yeah, that‘s true, because you are such an amazing musician. But specifically the part in the middle.
>
> **Me:** Listening now...
>
> **Me:** Dude.. this is a 20 minute track. What part are you talking about?
>
> **Him:** Ugh. Hold on. OK. At like 12:15 - 15:00
>
> **Me: ** Oh! Yeah, this does sound great. New song potential?

######* Paraphrasing 

These conversations are so frustrating that we don’t have them very often anymore. But we totally would, if it were easier to share clips.

He’s is a Software Engineer, and I am a Product Designer, so the solution to our woes quickly made itself clear: build an app!

## SITEMAP & INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

User flows and site maps are incredibly useful when starting up a project, especially when it comes to pairing up with engineers. They’re also one of the funnest things to design, because arrows.

The site map to the right shows that as soon a user lands on the homepage they can start using the product by uploading a track. Try before you buy has been shown to improve conversion rates, and provides a more frictionless experience. We check the filenames automatically, and if the file matches a track already in the user’s library we provide the option to store it as a version.

When a user attempts to save or share the project we’ll provide the option to create an account and create a group for collaborating with their friends or bandmates.
